### What is Molecular Nodes?
Molecular Nodes provides a convenient method for importing structural biology files into Blender, and several nodes for working with atomic data inside of Blender's Geometry Nodes.

Blender's Geometry Nodes provides a powerful interface for procedural modelling and animation. Currently it is limited in its ability to read any kind of structured data file as input, that isn't a 3D mesh. Molecular Nodes bridges this gap by providing an interface for converting `.pdb` and other file types into meshes that are usable by Geometry Nodes.

## Acknowledgements
This addon is built crucially around the python library [`atomium`](https://github.com/samirelanduk/atomium), which provides a great lightweight and pure-python way to to parse a variety of structural biology files, that interface nicely with the built-in python interpreter that is bundled with Blender.

The molecular dynamics trajectrory import is enabled by the [MDAnalysis package](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis).

This addon is built using the _excellent_ plugin for creating addons [Serpens](https://joshuaknauber.notion.site/Serpens-Documentation-d44c98df6af64d7c9a7925020af11233), which made the process of compiling a clear and concise addon, significantly reducing development time an creating a better addon overall.

Importantly none of this would be possible without the [Blender](https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/) and the [Blender Foundation](https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/) and the fantastic work of all the developers, from the community and the foundation itself. 

> ### This documentation is currently not complete for all of the nodes, but there should be enough to get you started. More complete documentation is in the works.

## Installation

Please see the [installation page](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes/installation.html) of the documentation on how to install Molecular Nodes in Blender, and the [examples page](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes/examples.html) on how to get started. 

You can also watch the [tutorial series on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvmFaRVmZRU) on how to use Molecular Nodes.
