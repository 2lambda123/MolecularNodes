To install molecular nodes, download the [latest release](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/releases) from the github releases page.
Ensure that you have a version of Molecular Nodes that matches the version of Blender you have installed.

::: callout-caution
## Blender Version 3.4

Molecular Nodes `2.0` is only compatible with Blender 3.4 & above.\
\
There are earlier versions of MN which are compatible with earlier versions of Blender, but these are no longer being developed or maintained and it is highly recommended that you use the most recent Blender and Molecular Nodes.

Details for each release are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/releases).

### Enable the Add-on

Tick the box in the upper-left corner to enable it.![](images/CleanShot%202022-05-19%20at%2014.54.44.png)

## Installing Additional Dependencies

Molecular Nodes is now installed and enabled and the nodes are available for use inside of Geometry Nodes.
To be able to download or open structure files however, you will need to install additional python dependencies which are detailed below.

### Installing Biotite & MDAnalysis

To be able to download from the [wwPDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) and open local `.pdb` and `.mmcif` files, click the 'Install Atomium' button, which will install the python package [Biotite](https://www.biotite-python.org/) and make it available to Blender's bundled Python.

This will hopefully download and install the required pacakges. If the panel changes and shows buttons to download structures, then the requried packages have been installed successfully.
