    "text": "All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdds int attribute for secondary structure of proteins when imported via Biotite. Atoms in a residue are given an integer value to specificy their secondary structure (#160):\n\n0 = ’’ = non-protein or not assigned by biotite annotate_sse\n1 = a = alpha helix\n2 = b = beta sheet\n3 = c = coil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFix consistency in load_trajectory function call. custom_selections were being taken from the GUI from inside the md.load_trajectory() function, rather being passed in as a function which is now the case. (#182)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBumped version of biotite to install 0.36.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFix for custom selections panel with MDAnalysis import.\nBlender crashed when using MDAnlysis import filter, if bonds were present in the topology. (#177)\n\nFixed created during refactor that disabled the custom selection list for MD import.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom text input for creating selections of res_id ranges and indivual numbers thanks to @YaoYinYing (#149), enabling quicker creation of complex selections inside of Molecular Nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefactor of package installation via pip, to help with those who require pip mirrors and provide more information when installation fails on ARM macs. (#162)\nRemoved redundant python submodules and general cleanup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange translations for other languages to bpy.app.translations.pgettext_data() from bpy.app.translations.pgettext() which reduces potential conflicts with other addons. (#147)\nFixed chain_id_unique not being added when importing via MDAnalysis, stopping custom nodes relying on chain information to break. (#156)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanel for adding multiple selection strings, which will become boolean attributes on the imported model when importing via MDAnalysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBall and stick node sphers now support field input for scaling the radius\nError with initial node setup breaking when in non-english Blender UI (#139) contributed by @YaoYinYing\nProblems with biological assemblies failling on larger structures. (#143)\nProblem with Animate Frames node defaulting to wrong from range on start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue on linux and with newer versions of Numpy where np.bool is deprecated and was erroring on import.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmulti-model b_factor is added when importing from .pdb files via biotite #133\n‘Invert’ field option to atom_properties and other selection nodes to optionally invert the selection\nAdded better detection of ligands and modifcations (such as sugars) and a separate selection node for them. Currently ligands are stored on the res_name attribute, starting at 100 and incrementing one for each unique ligand.\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_bonds option was not being utilised on MD import #132\nMOL_animate_res_wiggle was wiggling the OXT (res_name == 38) oxygen when a peptide chain ended. Added additional selection to not wiggle this atom, which should only ever appear when a peptide chain terminates.\nfixed import of vdw_radii for elements not supported by biotite (such as Fe) by moving vdw_radii to the data dictionary rather than relying on a function from biotite which had a limited dictionary for vdw_radii lookup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\natom_name attribute, which is a numerical representation of the atom name (C, CA, C5 etc)\n\nDicussed in #118\nAllows for more precise selections for new styling and animation nodes\n\nReimplemented amino acid ‘wiggle’ node: using the atom_name attribute\n\n3x faster with the improved atom_name attribute and refactor of the underlying nodes\n\nReimplemented the amino acid to curve node\nRibbon Style Nucleic: A ribbon representation for nucleic acids to complement the ribbon represenation of the proteins from alpha carbons. Enabled now thanks to the atom_name attribute.\nCapturing the Index field in the selection node before the selection occurs, and added an Index field input to the MOL_animate_frames node to enable selection to occur before animating between frames, if the Pre-Sel Index field is used in the Index field of the MOL_animate_frames node\nAdded cutoff field for limiting the interpolation of atoms between frames based on a distance cutoff\nAdded bonds through MDAnalysis import when a trajectory supports it #129\nAdded is_solvent, is_nucleic and is_peptide boolean attributes when importing via MDAnalysis\nAdded frame-specific attribute occupancy which is added to each frame of the trajectory when imported via MDAnalysis. #128\n\n\n\n\n\nChanged naming of MOL_style_atoms to MOL_style_atoms_cycles and MOL_style_ribbon to MOL_style_ribbon_protein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHANGELOG.md for tracking changes to the project\nIssue templates for GitHub issues\nProper support for Fields for ribbon width, enabling ‘licorice’ representation amoung others\nTooltips documentation for each of the custom node groups that can be added in Geometry Nodes\nMore selection nodes for distance, XYZ slice and whole residues.\nCustom selections using a string when importing via MDAnalysis #123\nAdded option to disable interpolation of atom positions between frames\nAdded node for animating any field between frames of a trajectory (no fields currently added on import, but used in the new Aniamte Frames backend)\nUVs are now available for the ribbon mesh style, idea from ErikMarklund and implemented by quellenform\n\n\n\n\n\nError when defaulting to connect_via_distance() when importing with ‘Find Bonds’ enabled\nAdding of a color node which was mis-labelled and couldn’t be added\nNon-.gro topology files were failling to add vdw_radii attribute #124\nRemove use of np.int which is now deprecated and was causing errors when linking python on M1 Mac\nAttributes now available on ribbon mesh which are sampled from backbone\nChanged starting material to be appended instead of created, which should avoid duplication of material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError on reporting the success of improting a molecule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove usage of Atomium and switched to Biotite for most internal structural file parsing\nRemoved reliance upon Serpens to build the addon. Can now be developed by anybody without the requirements of additional Blender addons.\n\nAspects of the addon can now have changes tracked properly by git, rather than inside a binary .blend Serpens file.\nNow also allows easier and clearer contributions from others who wish to contribute\nCustom node trees still remain opaque to git unfortunately\n\nAttributes are now created and stored on the molecular model itself, removing the need for properties models that store the data XYZ positions. Makes the import process clearer, more robust and more easily expandable.\nBond information is available by default as edges of the mesh along with bond types\nImprove MDAnalysis installation and usage internally\nExpose operators and functions to Blender Python console to enable user scripting with the addon\n\nimport MolecularNodes as mn\n\n# to fetch structures from the protein data bank\nstruc_list = ['4ozs', '1xi4', '6n2y']\nfor pdb in struc_list:\n    mn.load.molecule_rcsb(pdb, starting_style = 1)\n\n# to open a local structure file\nmn.load.molecule_local('file_path_here.pdb', 'SomeMoleculeName', starting_style = 2)"

You can move the camera around just like in those other programs.\nYou can rotate the camera view either using the middle mouse button MMB, or using your touch pad if you are on a laptop. You can also click and drag the axis widget to rotate the camera.\nYou can pan the camera using Shift + MMB\nThe main difference is that you can also manipulate the 3D scene in front of you. You can select objects with a left click of the mouse, and move them around by Grabbing them with the G key.\nThe main actions that you use the 3D Viewport for are:\n\n\nG - Grabbing: Moving an object around in 3D space.\nS - Scaling: Changing the relative size of an object.\nR - Rotating: Rotating the object in 3D space.\n\nIn the 3D viewport, much like in real life, there are 3 axes of possible movement and direction. Inside of Blender they are X Y and Z. X and Y form the flat grid that you see in the viewport, being coloured TODO red and green respectively, while Z is the blue vertical axis. These are labelled and highlighted on the axis widget, which is present in the top right corner of the viewport. This will rotate as you rotate the view, so it can always be used as a reference point.\n\n\n\nThe axis widget, present in the 3D viewport."

Each node performs an action on the geometry that is passed into it, and the result of that action is passed out to the right.\n\nThink of it as creating a set of rules for the computer to follow. You define the rules, and the computer can follow those same rules, even if you start with a different data set.\n\nCombining multiple different nodes you can create protein models and complex 3D scenes. In the example below, there is a node tree which should be present on every new structure imported via MolecularNodes. The atoms and bonds are passed in from the left, the atoms are given a colour based on their element and their chain_id, and then the atoms are styled as atoms, scaling the atom radii to 1.00.\n\nThe starting style MOL_style_atoms_cycles is only visible via inside of the Cycles render engine. You can add other styles manipulate the data through other nodes, by adding them with Shift + A and navigating to the MolecularNodes panel at the bottom. There are several categories of nodes for different animations and styles. You can add the Ribbon Protein node, which will create a ribbon representation based on the alpha carbons in the structure. If there is not colour in the structure, ensure that the node has a material MOL_atomic_material at the bottom of the node."

Downloading from the wwPDB and opening local .pdb files with Biotite should work fine without MDAnalysis installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacOS M1 & M2\n\n\n\n\n\nBlender’s bundled python is unable to install python packages that require compilation on the user’s machine. Currently, MDAnalysis is missing a pre-compiled .whl to install, and thus installation will fail on M1 & M2 machines. You can download and pre-compile these packages on your machine yourself, following the below instructions.\nThis is the current fix for M1 / M2 machines, but will be fixed in future releases.\nIn short:\n\nInstall miniconda\nDownload and build the required pacakges for your system\n\nmkdir ~/MDAnalysis-wheel\ncd MDAnalysis-wheel\nconda create -n wheel-builder python=3.10 cython\nconda activate wheel-builder\npython -m pip wheel MDAnalysis==2.2.0 --cache-dir .\nconda deactivate\n\nInstall the built .whl packages, into Blender’s bundled python.

If you can’t find the solution there, please open a new issue on the GitHub page. Please don’t just DM or email me directly. It’s better to do problem solving out in the open, as others might have the same issue or someone other than me may already have a solution!"
